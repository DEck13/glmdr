\title{Rao Tests}

\author{Charles J. Geyer}

\maketitle

Let $l_n$ be the log likelihood for sample size $n$ for some statistical
model, and let $\theta^*_n$ be the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)
for a smooth submodel.
The Rao test statistic is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rao}
   R_n = 
   \bigl(\nabla l_n(\theta^*_n)\bigr)^T J_n(\theta^*_n)^{-1}
   \nabla l_n(\theta^*_n),
\end{equation}
where 
$$
   J_n(\theta) = - \nabla^2 l_n(\theta)
$$
is the observed Fisher information matrix for sample size $n$
(this is copied from the lecture notes
\url{http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/8112/notes/tests.pdf}).

Note that $l_n$ and $J_n$ are for the larger model of the two nested
models being compared and that $\theta^*_n$ is the MLE for the smaller
model of the two \emph{expressed in the parameter space of the larger
model}.
