# to add extra compiler warnings
# note that file myMakevars must be a copy of glmdr/src/Makevars
#     with extra stuff added
export R_MAKEVARS_USER=`pwd`/myMakevars
# this is totally unnecessary unless and until we have C code in this package

# if version number has changed
rm *.tar.gz

# basic checking
R CMD build glmdr
R CMD check glmdr_*.tar.gz

# build for CRAN submission
R CMD build --compact-vignettes glmdr
# this check must be done by R-devel before CRAN submission
~/local/devel/bin/R CMD check --as-cran glmdr_*.tar.gz

# look at files packed in tarball for any weird stuff
tar ztvf glmdr_*.tar.gz | sed 's/^.*glmdr\///' | sort

# export usually not necessary
export VALGRIND_OPTS="--tool=memcheck"
R CMD check --no-vignettes --use-valgrind glmdr

# to install
R CMD INSTALL glmdr_*.tar.gz

# to count lines of code
cloc glmdr_*.tar.gz
# except the version with Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't understand R
# get current version, which is just perl script
# somewhere, say in ~/bin if that is in your path do
wget https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/releases/download/1.74/cloc-1.74.pl
mv cloc-1.74.pl cloc
chmod +x cloc
Then above will do the right thing
